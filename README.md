# Alfonso X

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/diegojromerolopez/alfonsox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/diegojromerolopez/alfonsox)


## What's this?

A simple spellchecking tool to make easy the spellchecking of code files.

The aim is to use it with [overcommit](https://github.com/brigade/overcommit)
and automatically spellcheck code files with a pre-commit git hook.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'alfonsox'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install alfonsox

## Setup

Make sure you have [hunspell](http://hunspell.github.io/) installed
in your system.

### Check your dictionaries

Use

```bash
hunspell -D
```

to see your search paths and available dictionaries.

### Install additional dictionaries

#### GNU/Linux

Install myspell dictionaries and avoid trouble:

```bash
# e.g.: install Spanish dictionary.
sudo apt install myspell-es 
```

```bash
# e.g.: install US English dictionary.
sudo apt install myspell-en-us
```

#### MacOS

Download some Hunspell dictionaries
(e.g. [LibreOffice dictionaries](https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries))
and copy them in the following location: **/Users/<your user>/Library/Spellings**.

#### Windows

[Follow this tutorial](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-04/msg00030.html)
to install dictionaries in Windows.

## Usage

### Load dictionaries

```ruby
# Load Hunspell dictionary from your system
# Make sure you have installed your dictionaries 
dictionary = AlfonsoX::SpellChecker::Dictionary::Hunspell.new('en_US')

# Or, alternatively you can load Hunspell dictionary from a local path
# Make sure the following files exist:
# - YOUR_PATH/dictionaries/en_US.aff 
# - YOUR_PATH/dictionaries/en_US.dic 
dictionary = AlfonsoX::SpellChecker::Dictionary::Hunspell.new(
  'en_US', "YOUR_PATH/dictionaries/en_US"
)
```

### Spellcheck some files

```ruby
dictionaries = [
  AlfonsoX::SpellChecker::Dictionary::Hunspell.new('en_US'),
  AlfonsoX::SpellChecker::Dictionary::Hunspell.new('es_US')
]
# Create spellchecker
spellchecker = AlfonsoX::SpellChecker::Main.new(
  "directory/with/files/**/*.rb",
  dictionaries
)

# Check the files
incorrect_words = spellchecker.check

# incorrect_words is a dict where
# the keys area the path of each one of the files that have at least one wrong word
# and the values are a list of incorrect words 
```

## Configuration

Create a YML file with the following structure to set up configuration of the spellchecking process:

```yaml
Paths:
  - 'lib/**.rb'
  - 'test/**.rb'
Dictionaries:
  MyEnglishDictionary:
    type: 'hunspell'
    path: 'test/dictionaries/en_US'
    language: 'en_US'
  MyRubymineDictionary:
    type: 'rubymine'
    path: '.idea/dictionary.xml'
```
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
