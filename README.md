A simple spellchecking tool to make easy the spellchecking of code files.

The aim is to use it with [overcommit](https://github.com/brigade/overcommit)
and automatically spellcheck code files with a pre-commit git hook.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'alfonsox'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install alfonsox

## Setup

Make sure you have [hunspell](http://hunspell.github.io/) installed
in your system.

No installation of dictionaries is required as this package already contains
LibreOffice dictionaries from
[LibreOffice dictionaries repository](https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries).

## Usage

## From terminal

### Define a configuration file

Create a YML file with the following structure to set up configuration of the spellchecking process:

```yaml

# Paths the files to ve spellchecked are
Paths:
  - 'lib/**.rb'
  - 'test/**.rb'
  - '... other paths that will be spellcheck'

# Dictionaries, choose one or all of these options
#Note the name of these subsections can be customized,
# i.e. instead of MyEnglishDictionaryFromLocalPath you can write
# LocalDictionary, for example.
Dictionaries:

  # Use a hunspell dictionary included in your project
  MyEnglishDictionaryFromLocalPath:
    type: 'hunspell'
    # Local hunspell dictionaries (.aff and .dic files)
    path: 'my-local-path/dictionaries'
    language: 'en_US'
  
  # Use a hunspell dictionary from this gem
  MyEnglishDictionaryFromGem:
      type: 'hunspell'
      language: 'en_US'
  
  # If you use Rubymine, it is very useful to
  # include your custom dictionary
  MyRubymineDictionary:
    type: 'rubymine'
    # Optional, by default is '.idea/dictionary.xml'
    path: '.idea/dictionary.xml'
  
  # Include in this section a list of custom words or words
  # that do not appear in other dictionaries
  WordListDictionary:
   type: 'word_list'
   word_list:
    - 'alfonso'
    - 'babik'
    - 'queryset'
    - 'txt'
```

e.g.

```yaml
Paths:
  - 'app/*/**.rb'
  - 'lib/**.rb'
  - 'test/**.rb'
Dictionaries:
  EnglishDictionaryFromGem:
      type: 'hunspell'
      language: 'en_US'
  RubymineDictionary:
    type: 'rubymine'
```

### Call the rake task


```bash
bundle exec rake spellcheck[<path/where/alfonsox.yml/file/is>]
```

e.g.:

```bash
bundle exec rake spellcheck[alfonsox.yml]
```

## From code

### Load dictionaries

```ruby
# Load Hunspell dictionary from your system
# Make sure you have installed your dictionaries 
dictionary = AlfonsoX::SpellChecker::Dictionary::Hunspell.new('en_US')

# Or, alternatively you can load Hunspell dictionary from a local path
# Make sure the following files exist:
# - YOUR_PATH/dictionaries/en_US/en_US.aff 
# - YOUR_PATH/dictionaries/en_US/en_US.dic 
dictionary = AlfonsoX::SpellChecker::Dictionary::Hunspell.new(
  'en_US', "YOUR_PATH/dictionaries"
)
```

### Spellcheck some files

```ruby
dictionaries = [
  AlfonsoX::SpellChecker::Dictionary::Hunspell.new('en_US'),
  AlfonsoX::SpellChecker::Dictionary::Hunspell.new('es_US')
]
# Create spellchecker
spellchecker = AlfonsoX::SpellChecker::Main.new(
  "directory/with/files/**/*.rb",
  dictionaries
)

# Check the files
incorrect_words = spellchecker.check

# incorrect_words is a dict where
# the keys area the path of each one of the files that have at least one wrong word
# and the values are a list of incorrect words 
```
